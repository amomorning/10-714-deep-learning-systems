    "## Introduction\n",
    "We have added a Metal backend to Needle framework to enable GPU acceleration for deep learning computations on M1 Mac. Metal is Apple's graphics framework that provides a low-level programming language called Metal Shading Language (MSL) for writing high-performance shaders and speeding up computations. By using the Metal backend, Needle framework can take advantage of the high-performance GPU on Apple devices and provide faster training speeds and higher performance for deep learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, Needle framework also includes a high-level NN module library, which provides a set of neural network layers and components that can be easily combined to create complex model architectures. This library is designed to be flexible and modular, allowing users to easily experiment with different model configurations and architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Needle framework is designed to provide users with a balance of low-level acceleration and high-level convenience, making it easy to build and train deep neural networks for a variety of tasks."
